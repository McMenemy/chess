  start with king and knight class
  switch out all possible moves with recursive adjacent object orientated communication
    null pieces need to know all neighbors
    sliding pieces only need to know adjacent neighbors in movement direction
    pawn only needs to know front three neighbors
    king and knigh dont need to know anything
